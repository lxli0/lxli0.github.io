  Welcome! I am Linxuan Li (李林轩), an undergraduate majoring in Geophysics at Wuhan University. 
  I am keen on everything associated with tectonics, especially earthquakes. 
  My research focuses on both observational data and theoretical models. 
  I use techniques from disciplines such as seismology, geodynamics, geodesy, math, and physics.
  <br>
  <br>
  During my stay at Wuhan University, I mainly focus on how the Earth's crust responds to surface hydrosphere variations. 
  I conduct several studies from different perspectives, such as surface deformation, seismicity, and seismic velocity. 
  I find it is an interdisciplinary problem and can provide ideal natural experiments to help understand the Earth's crust and earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the future, I will explore broader areas. I hope to devote my life to exploring the phenomena
  associated with and the physical processes behind earthquakes/volcanoes/landslides/tsunamis so that we can better understand our planet,
  produce clean energy, and mitigate natural disasters.
