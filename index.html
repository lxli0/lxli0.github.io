  Welcome! I am Linxuan Li, an undergraduate majoring in Geophysics at Wuhan University. 
  I am keen on everything associated with tectonics, especially earthquakes. 
  My research focuses on both observational data and theatrical models. 
  I use techniques from disciplines such as seismology, geodynamics, geodesy, math, and physics.
  <br>
  <br>
  During my stay at Wuhan University, I mainly focus on how the earth's crust responds to surface hydrosphere variations. 
  I conduct several studies from different perspectives, such as surface deformation, seismicity rate, and seismic velocity. 
  I find it is an interdisciplinary problem and can provide ideal natural experiments to help understand the crust and earthquakes.
  <br>
  <br>
  In the future, I will explore broader areas. I hope to devote my life to exploring the phenomena
  associated with and the physical processes behind earthquakes so that we can better understand our planet 
  and may survive natural disasters.
