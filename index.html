  Welcome! I am Linxuan Li, an undergraduate majoring in Geophysics at Wuhan University. I am keen on everything associated with tectonics, especially earthquakes. My research focus on both observational data and theatrical models. I use techniques from different disciplines, such as seismology, geodynamics, geodesy, math, and physics.

  During my stay in Wuhan University, my research mainly focuses on how the earth's crust responds to surface hydrosphere variations. I conduct several studies from different perspective, such as surface deformation, seismic activity, and seismic velocity. I find it is an interdisciplinary problem, and can create ideal natural experiments to help us understand the crust and earthquakes.

  In the future, I will explore broader areas. Over all, I hope to devote my life to exploring the phenomenon associated with and the physical processes behind earthquakes, so that we will better understand our planet and may possibly survive from natural disasters.
