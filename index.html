  Welcome! I am Linxuan Li (李林轩), an undergraduate majoring in Geophysics at             
  <a href="http://main.sgg.whu.edu.cn/">School of Geodesy and Geomatics</a>, Wuhan University.
  In September 2023, I will start working on my PhD in the <a href="https://www.seismolab.caltech.edu/">Seismo Lab</a>
  at California Institute of Technology.
  I am keen on everything associated with tectonics, especially earthquakes. 
  My research focuses on both observational data and theoretical models. 
  I use techniques from disciplines such as seismology, geodynamics, geodesy, math, and physics.
  <br>
  <br>
  During my stay at Wuhan University, I mainly focus on a) the response of Earth's crust to natural and anthropogenic surface/subsurface disturbance, and b) the magnitude–frequency distributions of earthquake sequences.
  I hope to devote my life to exploring the phenomena associated with and the physical processes behind earthquakes so that we can better understand our planet,
  produce clean energy, and mitigate natural disasters.
