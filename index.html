Welcome! My name is Paul and I am a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C. and also teach Text Mining for Economics and Finance at the University of Maryland.

<br><br>
My research focuses on understanding the role banks play in the real economy. I often incorporate machine learning and natural language processing techniques into my research to quantify unstructured information such as text. Feel free to look at my <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">research page</a> and my <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">tutorials</a> to learn more!

I am currently a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board. I also enjoy teaching and am an adjunct professor for Text Mining for Economics and Finance at the University of Maryland in the Robert H. Smith School of Business. Previously, from 2018-2022, I was a financial economist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporate (FDIC) where I conducted banking research and developed models to support FDIC operations. In July 2018, I finished my PhD in Economics from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra and Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. I started my academic career in mathematics, with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from University of California, Berkeley. I spent time working alongside other central banks through an 8 month visit in Germany at the Deutsche Bundesbank and ongoing research projects with the Banco de la Rep&uacute;blica of Colombia. Previously, I did internships in the credit department of Moody's Analytics and in various investment funds. Outside of economics and finance, I like learning about natural language processing, innovations in machine learning, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and improv comedy.
