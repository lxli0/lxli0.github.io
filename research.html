        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
         Accurately characterizing the magnitude–frequency distribution (MFD) of earthquakes is vital for advancing our understanding of 
          earthquake physics and improving seismic hazard assessments. In this study, we address key issues in distinguishing between the 
          classic Gutenberg–Richter distribution and its prominent alternative, the tapered Gutenberg–Richter distribution, which assumes a 
          reduced frequency of larger earthquakes. We find the most effective approach, identify the conditions under which these two 
          distributions can be distinguished, and propose an objective and automatic method to describe the temporal evolution of MFD. 
          Based on these insights, we revisit several earthquake sequences and demonstrate the practical applicability of both distributions, 
          highlighting their relevance in natural and induced seismicity contexts.

        <br>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
          Seismic interferometry is widely used to detect changes in the subsurface. In many previous studies, changes in Rayleigh-wave 
          velocity were interpreted as changes in shear wave velocity at specific depths, based on computed frequency-dependent sensitivity 
          kernels (low frequencies are related to deep depth). An important prerequisite for this assumption is that the S-wave 
          velocity changes at different depths are close. In this study, we use evidence from laboratory experiments, field 
          measurements, and seismic surface wave and coda wave results to show that, under the same 
          stress perturbation, the wave speed changes in shallow rocks are much greater than those in deep rocks. 
          On this basis, we suggest that changes in low-frequency Rayleigh-wave velocities may originate from the very 
          shallow crust (80% of the velocity changes may originate from the top 1 km), 
          calling for a reevaluation of the explanation for wave speed changes.

        <br>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
          People tried to use Gutenberg–Richter <i>b</i>-values for short-term earthquake forecasts, and this requires the premise
          of estimating reliable <i>b</i>-values for real-time seismic catalogs. In this study, through a series of numerical tests, 
          we investigate the performance of three methods, including the commonly used maximum likelihood estimation method 
          and two relatively new <i>b</i>-value estimation methods, namely the <i>b</i>-positive and <i>K−M</i> slope 
          methods, on calculating <i>b</i>-values for real-time seismic catalogs. We also apply these three methods to both observed 
          seismic catalogs and synthetic real-time seismic catalogs. We suggest it seems difficult to obtain accurate <i>b</i>-values
          for real-time earthquake catalogs, but the combination of these methods may give a better judgment—if all three methods 
          suggest that the change in <i>b</i>-value is significant, the probability of making a wrong decision is very low.

        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
          The <i>b</i>-value from the Gutenberg–Richter law is an essential parameter in seismological studies. 
          However, its estimation faces many uncertainties. We generate synthetic seismic catalogs 
          that obey various probability distributions and find that 1) the <i>KMS</i> from Visibility
          Graph Analysis is universally proportional to the <i>b</i>-value once the catalog size is given; 2) the <i>KMS</i> estimation can
          perform better than <i>b</i>-value estimation for many catalogs. We apply the <i>KMS</i> 
          estimation to the real observed seismic catalog and find general consistency with 
          traditional <i>b</i>-value estimation methods. We suggest that the KMS can be used as a verification of or a supplement to <i>b</i>-value.

        <br>
        <p style="text-align:justify"> 
          The TGR area is located in the stable Yangtze paraplatform. 
          Because of human regulation, the reservoir water level and natural rainfall, which are suggested
          to modulate seismicity, show opposite seasonal patterns.
          We find the regional seismicity can be divided into two groups according to the distances to the reservoir.
          Their productivity is proportional to the reservoir water level and precipitation, respectively. 
          The elastic response of reservoir water level rise can trigger most earthquakes near the reservoir. 
          The rainfall-induced pore pressure, a widely discussed mechanism, cannot explain the earthquakes far from the reservoir.
          The combination of natrual-hydrosphere-induced elastic load and pore pressure may cause a signal consistent with rainfall
          and may explain these earthquakes.
