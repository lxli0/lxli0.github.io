          The TGR area is located in the stable Yangtze paraplatform. 
            Because of human regulation, the reservoir water level and natural rainfall, which are suggested
            to modulate regional seismicity, show opposite seasonal patterns.
            We find that seismicity can be divided into two groups according to the distances to the reservoir, with different seasonality. 
            Their productivity is proportional to reservoir water level and precipitation, respectively. 
            The elastic response of the reservoir water level can trigger most earthquakes near the reservoir. 
            The rainfall-induced pore pressure cannot explain the earthquakes far from the reservoir.
