        <p align="left"> 
          Seasonal variations in surface-wave velocity have been observed worldwide and are usually attributed to various environmental changes. 
          But there is still no convincing quantitative research that can explain both the amplitude and phase.
          We first deduce the seasonal changes in body waves by integrating elastic load and pore pressure. Due to the high confining pressure, 
          S-wave velocity perturbation in the deep rock is much smaller than in the shallow rock under the same stress change. Under this assumption, 
          we find that even the seasonal variation in the phase velocity of the low-frequency Rayleigh wave comes from the shallow crust.
          This theory can explain why the difference between the observed velocity changes caused by earthquakes (step) and by environmental 
          factors (seasonal) is usually much smaller than the difference between their related stresses.

        <p align="left"> 
          The <i>b</i>-value from the Gutenberg–Richter law is an essential parameter in seismological studies. 
          However, its estimation faces many uncertainties. We generate synthetic seismic catalogs 
          that obey various probability distributions and find that 1) the <i>KMS</i> from Visibility
          Graph Analysis is universally proportional to the <i>b</i>-value once the catalog size is given; 2) the <i>KMS</i> estimation can
          perform better than <i>b</i>-value estimation for many catalogs. We apply the <i>KMS</i> 
          estimation to the real observed seismic catalog and find general consistency with 
          traditional <i>b</i>-value estimation methods. We suggest that the KMS can be used as a verification of or a supplement to <i>b</i>-value.

        <br>
        <p align="left"> 
          The TGR area is located in the stable Yangtze paraplatform. 
          Because of human regulation, the reservoir water level and natural rainfall, which are suggested
          to modulate seismicity, show opposite seasonal patterns.
          We find the regional seismicity can be divided into two groups according to the distances to the reservoir.
          Their productivity is proportional to the reservoir water level and precipitation, respectively. 
          The elastic response of reservoir water level rise can trigger most earthquakes near the reservoir. 
          The rainfall-induced pore pressure, a widely discussed mechanism, cannot explain the earthquakes far from the reservoir.
          The combination of natrual-hydrosphere-induced elastic load and pore pressure may cause a signal consistent with rainfall
          and may explain these earthquakes.
