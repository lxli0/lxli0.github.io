  The TGR area is located in the stable Yangtze paraplatform. 
    Because of human regulation, the reservoir water level and natural rainfall, which are suggested
    to modulate regional seismicity, show opposite seasonal patterns.
    We find that seismicity can be divided into two groups according to the distances to the reservoir, with different seasonality. 
    Their productivity is proportional to reservoir water level and precipitation, respectively. 
    The elastic response of the reservoir water level can trigger most earthquakes near the reservoir. 
    The rainfall-induced pore pressure cannot explain the earthquakes far from the reservoir.

  <p align="left"> 
  The <i>b</i>-value from the Gutenberg–Richter law is an essential parameter in seismological studies. 
                 However, its estimation faces many uncertainties. We generate synthetic seismic catalogs 
                 that obey various probability distributions and find that 1) the <i>KMS</i> from Visibility
                 Graph Analysis is universally proportional to the <i>b</i>-value; 2) the <i>KMS</i> estimation can
                 perform better than <i>b</i>-value estimation for many catalogs. We apply the <i>KMS</i> 
                 estimation to the real observed seismic catalog and find general consistency with 
                 traditional <i>b</i>-value estimation methods.
