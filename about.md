  Like many geophysicists, I find visualization fascinating. Currently, I am trying to build a color database called <b>PORCOLOR</b> utilizing traditional Chinese porcelain. Finding a non-repeating color scheme suitable for scientific research from numerous artifacts is not an easy task. I will update it from time to time.

<b><i>Note:</i></b> The color scheme I provided here is to distinguish different types of data. If you need color maps, I recommend <a href="https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps">Scientific colour maps</a>.
